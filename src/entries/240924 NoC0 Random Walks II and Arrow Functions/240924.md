## Random Walk: class methods, arrow functions
Arrow functions serve two primary purposes: simplification of syntax and tighter control over the 'this' context.

For `p.setup` and `p.draw`, arrow functions are essential due to p5.js instance mode mechanics. When creating a new p5 instance, a function is passed that configures the sketch. This function must assign functions to `p.setup` and `p.draw`, rather than declaring them as methods. Arrow functions ensure that `this` within these functions refers to the p5 instance, which is crucial for accessing p5 methods and properties.

Traditional class methods handle complex uses of `this` within the class context effectively. However, `p.setup` and `p.draw` are not class methods - they're properties of the p5 instance that require function assignments.

The use of arrow functions for `p.setup` and `p.draw` is a specific requirement when working with p5.js in instance mode. It ensures the correct context is maintained when these functions are invoked by the p5 library.

{% sketchContainer "randomwalk_240924.js", "randomwalk_240924" %}

### Traditional method (like C#): `step() { ... }`

### Arrow function as a property: `step = () => { ... }`

### Main sketch function: 
This is a regular function declaration. It's used as the main container for our p5.js sketch.
```typescript
function randomwalk_240924(p: typeof p5) { ... }
```

### Class methods:
These use the traditional method syntax in classes. They're concise and work well for methods that might use 'this' in more complex ways.
```typescript
constructor() { ... }
step() { ... }
```

### Arrow function class methods:
These are class properties assigned arrow functions. They're great for short methods and automatically bind 'this' to the instance.
```typescript
show = () => p.point(this.x, this.y);
changeShade = () => Math.floor(Math.random() * 256);
```

### p5.js setup and draw:
These use arrow functions to assign the setup and draw methods to the p5 instance. This ensures 'this' refers to the p5 instance inside these functions.
```typescript
p.setup = () => { ... };
p.draw = () => { ... };
```

### Example of p5.js instance mode:
Here, `randomwalk_240924` is a function that takes a `p5` instance as an argument. Inside this function, `p.setup` and `p.draw` are assigned arrow functions. This assignment is crucial for the p5.js instance mode to work correctly.

The last line creates a new `p5` instance, passing the `randomwalk_240924` function as the sketch setup. This is **where the p5 library will call the assigned setup and draw functions, **using the correct context thanks to the arrow function syntax.

Arrow functions do not having their own bindings to `this` and that is precisely what gives them tight control over `this` in certain contexts. In the case of p5.js instance mode, this behavior is advantageous.

When arrow functions are used for `p.setup` and `p.draw`, they inherit `this` from the enclosing scope, which is the p5 instance. This ensures that `this` inside these functions always refers to the p5 instance, regardless of how they are called.

This behavior prevents issues that could arise with traditional function expressions, **where `this` can change based on how the function is invoked**. By using arrow functions, the code guarantees that p5 methods and properties are always accessible within setup and draw, maintaining the correct context for the sketch's execution.
