# Testing D3.js

## D3.js

**D3.js** (Data-Driven Documents) is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. It allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document. This flexibility makes it a powerful tool for creating custom charts and graphs.
